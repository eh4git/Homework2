In this project I have created a website to showcase the work I have completed during my time in the Web Development Boot Camp at UCLA Extension. This website currently consists of a profile page, an about me, and a contact page. The entire site has a consistent navigation bar that functions properly as well as a sticky footer that is translucent. On the navigation bar there are links to my LinkedIn and my GitHub profile. The pages are responsive and will scale without distorting images. The profile page consists of a carousel of images followed by a card and a paragraph section. The paragraph section has a top row containing the paragraph with a sub row made up of three columns where links to project repositories will be placed after their creation. Under the first card and paragraph section is another two cards. The cards will include information about a project underneath a screenshot of the project. The about me page has a basic layout completed and has an area that has been commented out until it is finished. The contact page has a form to fill out that includes email, links, and a text area. The functionality of the form will be addressed in the future after a better understanding of JavaScript is achieved.
